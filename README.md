# E-Commerce App
This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built with Angular 19 (frontend) and .NET 9 (backend). It supports user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and order processing. The frontend uses Angular CLI, while the backend exposes RESTful APIs. The app connects to SQL Server, Redis (caching) and is designed for scalability.
